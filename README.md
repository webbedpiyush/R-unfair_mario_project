# Unfair Mario R Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Unfair Mario R Project for the 2nd-year B.Tech course! This project is designed to explore and analyze the infamous game "Unfair Mario" using R programming. Unfair Mario is known for its challenging and deceptive nature, making it an interesting subject for a programming project.

## Project Description

### Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to apply and demonstrate your R programming skills to analyze various aspects of the Unfair Mario game. You will explore game mechanics, player performance, and other relevant metrics to gain insights into the challenges presented by this game.

### Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: Gather data related to Unfair Mario gameplay, including player movements, deaths, and other relevant information.

- **Data Analysis**: Utilize R programming to analyze the collected data, extracting meaningful patterns, trends, and insights.

- **Visualization**: Create visualizations using R packages to represent key findings graphically.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical techniques to draw conclusions about player performance and game difficulty.

- **Level Difficulty Metrics**: Compute and analyze the difficulty of different levels in Unfair Mario.

- **Uncertainty Analysis**: Explore and visualize uncertainty in player movements and outcomes.

- **Final Metric**: Develop a final metric to assess overall game difficulty.

- **Recommendations**: Discuss implications for level designers based on the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from the following links:

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahil-Gulihar/R-unfair_mario_project.git
cd unfair-mario-r-project
```

Open the R project in RStudio and install the required packages:

```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "readr"))
```

### Usage

1. Run the data collection script to gather gameplay data.
2. Execute the data analysis script to analyze the collected data.
3. Explore the visualizations generated by the project to understand Unfair Mario better.

## Additional Points

### The Data Set

The project includes a dataset that captures various aspects of Unfair Mario gameplay, such as player movements, deaths, and other relevant information.

### Checking the Data Set

Verify the integrity of the dataset and ensure it aligns with the expected format before conducting any analysis.

### Computing Level Difficulty

Utilize R programming to compute and assess the difficulty of each level in Unfair Mario based on player performance.

### Plotting Difficulty Profile

Generate visualizations that represent the difficulty profile of different levels, providing a comprehensive overview.

### Spotting Hard Levels

Identify and highlight levels that pose significant challenges to players, helping to pinpoint areas of interest.

### Computing Uncertainty

Apply statistical methods to compute and analyze uncertainty in player movements and outcomes.

### Showing Uncertainty

Visualize the uncertainty in player actions and outcomes, offering insights into the variability of gameplay.

### A Final Metric

Develop a final metric that combines various factors to provide an overall assessment of game difficulty.

### Should Our Level Designer Worry?

Discuss the implications of the analysis for level designers, providing insights into areas that may require attention or adjustment.
